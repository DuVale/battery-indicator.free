    provides an icon that lives in the status bar and shows you the
    percentage of battery charge left.\n

    \nThis Pro version offers a great deal more utility than that,
    however.  Besides offering red, amber, and green icons, it also
    has the following key features as of version 3.0:\n

    \n• Fully configurable estimated charge/discharge time left.
    \n• Logging of battery state.
    \n• Themes for the main window (including a full-size window with
    large, easy-to-read text).
    \n• Manually disable/reenable the device lock screen, with the option
    to automatically disable it when plugged in and reenable it when unplugged.
    \n• Many more useful things that you\'ll discover throughout.

  <string name="help_cat_limitations">Limitations</string>
  <string name="help_limitations">(<i>These
    are out of my control.</i>)\n

    \n• The app can only display what the phone tells it. Most phones report
    every 1%, but a few (notably the Motorola Droid models) only report every
    10%.
    \n• There\'s no way to remove the built-in battery icon.
    \n• The notification icon in the status bar and the message you see in the
    notification tray are tied together — you can\'t have one without the other.
    \n• Many apps should allow installation to removable storage (SD card); some
    should not.  Battery Indicator is of the latter group.  See
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/wiki/FAQ">the project
      FAQ</a> if you\'d like further explanation.
  </string>

  <string name="help_cat_features">Features</string>
  <string name="help_features">
    • Small, simple, and easy to read.
    \n• It doesn\'t do any polling. It receives a broadcast message from the OS
    when the battery status changes, then it simply updates the icon and
    goes back to sleep. What this means is that it will take up a small
    amount of RAM, but essentially 0 CPU cycles, so it can\'t drain your
    battery.  I estimate that it will cost you about 1 minute of usage time
    off of a full discharge as a worst case scenario.  If you are experiencing
    anything worse than that, you probably have another app (such as a \"task
    killer\" app of some kind) interfering with Battery Indicator\'s normal
    operation.
    \n• Easy access to Battery Use screen (requires Android 1.6+).
    \n• Configure to always start on boot, never start on boot, or start on boot
    if the app was running on shutdown.
    \n• Lots more that I\'m either forgetting or seem too minor to mention on
    their on, but that add up to a great app.
    \n• The satisfaction of supporting the developer. (I really appreciate it!)

  <string name="settings_overview">Overview</string>
  <string name="settings_overview_help">
    The settings are organized into three separate pages, as described
    below.  Each page has its own help page describing the settings on
    that page.  Simply press MENU->Help to get help from whatever
    settings page you are on.
  </string>

  <string name="color_settings">Colors and Themes</string>
  <string name="color_settings_summary">Control icon colors and window themes</string>
  <string name="color_settings_help">

  </string>
  <string name="time_settings">Time Settings</string>
  <string name="time_settings_summary">Control time estimates and approximations</string>
  <string name="time_settings_help">
    Here you can control when the notification switches from saying
    exactly when the phone\'s status changed (unplugged, for example)
    to stating approximately how many hours ago the change happened.\n

    \nYou can also control which estimates you want to see for the
    time remaining for USB/AC charging and light/normal/heavy/constant
    usage, and adjust the basis for these estimates.
  </string>
  <string name="other_settings">Other Settings</string>
  <string name="other_settings_summary"></string>
  <string name="other_settings_help">
    All other settings are on this page, including logging, lock

  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_more_settings_in_pro">More Settings in Pro</string>
  <string name="pref_please_upgrade">
    The Pro version has many more settings and features, including
    green, amber, and red icons, window themes, battery state logging,
    auto/manual lock screen disable, charge/discharge remaining
    estimates, and more.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_themes">Themes</string>
  <string name="pref_main_window_theme">Main Window Theme</string>
  <string name="pref_main_window_theme_help">
    Sets the theme for the main window.  By default, the theme will
    roughly match a standard Android dialog, like Battery Indicator
    always has.  The Full Window theme is useful if you like things
    big and easy to read.  Other themes are just for fun.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_logging">Logging</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging">Enable Logging</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging_summary">Log battery state changes?</string>
  <string name="pref_enable_logging_help">
    If enabled, Battery Indicator will log battery state changes
    (e.g., the phone is unplugged or becomes fully charged). You can
    view the logs from the main window (press MENU and then select
    Logs).
  </string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything">Log Everything</string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything_summary">Log charge changes, too?</string>
  <string name="pref_log_everything_help">
    If enabled, Battery Indicator will also log every change in the
    charge level, as well (e.g., going from 57% to 56% or vice versa).
    Most users probably have no need for this, but you can turn it on
    if you really want to keep an eye on things.\n

    \nKeep in mind that using this setting will come at a slight
    performance cost, so while you may want to turn this on for a few
    hours or days to keep track of things, you\'ll likely want to turn
    it off when you\'re done.  Even with this on, Battery Indicator
    shouldn\'t take more than about 1 minute off of a full battery
    charge as a worst case.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_max_log_age">Maximum Log Age</string>
  <string name="pref_max_log_age_summary">Delete Logs Older Than:</string>
  <string name="pref_max_log_age_help">
    If logging is enabled, then whenever you plug in your phone, logs
    older than this will be deleted.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_keyguard">Lock Screen / Keyguard</string>
  <string name="pref_cat_keyguard_help">
    Android allows apps to disable and reenable what it calls the
    \"keyguard\", which you probably think of as the lock screen.
    Beyond simply disabling and reenabling it, however, there is no
    more control — I can\'t control which keys turn the screen on, for
    example.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable">Confirm Manual Disable</string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable_summary">Confirm when manually disabling lock screen?</string>
  <string name="pref_confirm_manual_disable_help">
    If checked, a confirmation dialog will pop up when you try to
    manually disable the lock screen.  This is primarily intended to
    prevent new users from accidentally disabling their lock screen
    without knowing it.  If you disable the lock screen with any
    regularity, you\'ll probably want to turn this off.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock">Exit After Toggling</string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock_summary">Exit main window immediately after dis/reenabling?</string>
  <string name="pref_finish_after_toggle_lock_help">
    If you\'re someone for whom every keystroke (or touchscreen press)
    matters, you\'ll probably want to enable this.  If your goal is to
    simply disable or reenable the lock screen and then get back to
    what you\'re doing, this keeps you from having to press the BACK
    key.  Just pull down the notification bar, press on Battery
    Indicator, and press the button to toggle the lock screen: three
    screen presses and you\'re back to what you were doing.\n

    \nFor obvious reasons, you can only enable this if the previous
    setting is disabled, and vice versa.
  </string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable">Auto-disable Lock Screen</string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable_summary">Disable the lock screen when charging?</string>
  <string name="pref_auto_disable_help">
    If checked, then whenever the device is plugged in, Battery
    Indicator with disable the lock screen, and whenever the device is
    unplugged, it will enable it again.\n

    \nNote that with this option enabled, you will still have to
    manually pass through the lock screen once before it will be
    auto-disabled.

  <string name="pref_disallow_disable_lock_screen_summary">Disallow use of the disable lock screen button?</string>

  <string name="pref_finish_after_battery_use_help">
    If you\'re someone for whom every keystroke (or touchscreen press)

    the old behavior of closing Battery Indicator\'s main window
    immediately after launching the Battery Use screen.

  <string name="pref_cat_temperature_unit">Temperature Unit</string>
  <string name="pref_convert_to_fahrenheit">Convert to Fahrenheit</string>
  <string name="pref_convert_to_fahrenheit_help">
    Android reports the battery temperature in degrees Celsius.  If
    you prefer to see the battery temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    check this option, and the app will convert for you.

  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot">Autostart at Boot</string>
  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot_summary">Start Battery Indicator When Device Boots?</string>
  <string name="pref_autostart_at_boot_help">
    Controls whether Battery Indicator should start itself
    automatically when the device boots up.\n

    \nThe \"If Running on Shutdown\" option works with regard to
    whether you\'ve most recently manually started or stopped Battery
    Indicator.  So if you kill Battery Indicator through some other
    means, like a task killer, then Battery Indicator doesn\'t know
    you stopped it, and it will still start at boot up if you have it
    set to this.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_charge_as_text">Textual Charge Level</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text">Textual Charge Level</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text_summary">Show the charge level as larger text next to icon?</string>
  <string name="pref_charge_as_text_help">
    I\'ve had a few users with poorer eyesight ask me to add this
    option, whereby the charge level is displayed as text (which is a
    bit larger and easier to read) right next to the icon when you
    pull down the notification area.  The actual icon won\'t be any
    different, so this will only help when you pull down the
    notification tray, but it\'s better than nothing, and easy enough
    to add for those that want it.\n

    \nTo save precious space, I\'ve done this in a very unglamorous
    fashion, simply plopping the number in there and carrying on. This
    turns out to be easier to read than if I included the percent
    symbol, and means that the text should all fit.  It is possible
    that if you have a particularly small device, enabling this might
    make the AM/PM at the far right not quite fit.

  <string name="pref_status_dur_est_summary">Start Approximating Hours Since Status Change</string>
  <string name="pref_status_dur_est_help">
    Determines when the notification switches from saying, e.g.,
    \"Unplugged Since 1:10 PM\" to saying something like \"Unplugged
    for 1 Hour\".  The first way is more accurate, because it tells
    you exactly (to the minute) when the status changed, but many
    people prefer the simpler to comprehend approximation of the
    number of elapsed hours, so they make that happen sooner than the
    default of 12 hours.
  </string>

  <string name="pref_cat_time_remaining_estimates">Time Remaining Estimates</string>
  <string name="pref_cat_time_remaining_estimates_help">
    I\'ve done these time remaining estimates a bit differently than
    you might be used to, but I think for the better.  You control
    what the app uses as a basis to estimate battery life, so if you
    think it\'s wrong, you can fix it.  I\'ve used what I think are
    reasonable defaults, but phones vary quite a bit, and how we use
    our phones varies even more, so you\'re going to have to tweak
    these settings.  But that\'s a good thing, because only you know
    what \"Normal Usage\" (et al) means to you, and you can actually
    put in times that work for you, rather than being annoyed if the
    estimates are wrong.

  <string name="pref_cat_color">Icon Color</string>
  <string name="pref_cat_color_help">
    In order to keep the binary package for Battery Indicator
    reasonably small, there are some limitations for the colors.  At
    the time of writing, you can have a red icon as high as 30%, an
    amber icon as high as 50%, and a green icon as low as 20%.  I
    think these are reasonable compromises that should work for 99% of
    users.\n

    \nTo give you maximum control, the colors can be turned on or off
    independently.  This means that you can have as much as a
    four-tiered color scheme, where the icon is green when it is very
    full, then grayscale, then amber, then red.  Of course, most
    people probably have the amber and green thresholds set to the
    same value, so that the icon is never grayscale.

    \nThis setting cleans up the Icon Color settings to make more sense

    According to user reports, that includes these devices:\n

    \n• Motorola Droid X
    \n• Motorola Droid 2
    \n• Samsung Moment\n

    \nAs far as I\'m aware, all other devices report every 1%, and so
    should <i>not</i> turn this on.
